Introduction to Rianddy

Distinct aspects:

1. I love sports and as a programmer, I have a strong body. lol
2. I am a highly self-motivated guy. So I'm good at learning.
3. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is really nice for programming.

General aspects: 

My undergraduate major is called “Information Management and Information System”, which is based on programming to build enterprise application so that I lay a solid foundation in this area. 
Now I am a Master of Information Science in University of Pittsburgh and I will graduate on December 14th, 2014. I accumulated lots of real projects’ experiences during this period as you can see on my resume. 
Then during three months’ summer internship in Bosch’s Research Technology Center, one of the world five hundred, I quickly impressed them with my enthusiasm and expertise in Java programming on software development projects. 

And I am now looking for a job for Java Software Engineer in California.
